**ALT.NET**

_The build is still in semi-active development_

>ABOUT

Alt.net is a netrunning CLI game made for fun. 
It combines cryptocurrency concept and adds networking features
in order to let people compete, communicate and build communities.
Alt.net is a game that offers fully hackable client
and a semi-closed-source server, that will be core of the game.
The main goals of a netrunner, is to collect artifacts that can be found within the grid,
collect as much Neon as possible and to climb up the leaderboard as high as possible,
using their own coding and reverse engineering skills.
Alt.net incorporates some features of oldschool BBSs.
Unlike Bitcoin, Etherium or other cryptocurrencies - Alt.net
uses relatively easy "mining operations" that does not involve blockchain. Ideally, 
instead of loading CPU with unnecessary, useless operations, the miner
would use relatively useful operations. Apparently, I'm too dum-dum
to come up with something that can be useful. Hoping to find something out in the future.

However, the project is still in development. 

I made this repository primarily as a side project
that would help me to get rid of procrastination 
and keep my coding skills in shape.

I managed to create the README.md with a proper markup :D
