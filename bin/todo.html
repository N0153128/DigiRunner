<b>ATOMIC FORGE</b><br /><br />
<b>>ABOUT</b><br /><br />

<it>Atomic Forge is a "cryptocurrency" made for fun. 
It does something in the background and generates 
Coins, that can be used in other services to purchase
products or services. This project can be integrated with
bots, websites and other platforms.
Unlike Bitcoin, Etherium or other cryptocurrencies - Atomic Forge
uses relatively easy "mining operations". Ideally, 
instead of loading CPU with unnecessary, useless operations, the miner
would use relatively useful operations. Apparently, I'm too dum-dum
to come up with something that can be useful. Hoping to find something out in the future.
<br />
However, the project is still in development. 
A current repository has only Proof of Concept, that will
be rewritten in other language, such as Java or (less possible) Rust.
<br />
I made this repository primarily as a side project
that would help me to get rid of procrastination 
and keep my coding skills in shape.
